AvangoDaemon NG
===============

The AvangoDaemon is an independent instance for communication with
a variety of devices that serve as input data for Avango NG applications.
The AvangoDaemon has its own main loop in which for each device a thread
is running. Therefore the devices are decoupled from the Avango NG
main loop. Via shared memory segment the Avango NG application
exchanges data with the device instances.

On Avango NG application side a DeviceSensor is used to read out data
coming from an appropriate input device. Whereas a DeviceActuator
can be used to send specific commands to the device, for example
see WiimoteActuator to set LEDs or Rumble modes on a connected
Nintendo Wiimote.

On AvangoDaemon side implementations for different devices exist.
Examples are:

HIDInput
    To communicate with USB devices via standardized input interface
    (such as keyboard, mouse and gamepads).

Wiimote
    A specific HIDInput to use a Nintendo Wiimote device.
    Note: This device has a dependency to a patched version of 'wminput'.
    (http://abstrakraft.org/cwiid with patches #34,#35 and #36)

DTrack
    For processing DTrack udp packets (ASCII protocol).

WacomTablet
    To communicate with a Wacom tablet.

VRPNClient
    A VRPN client consisting of vrpn_Tracker, vrpn_Button and vrpn_Analog devices.
    Note: This device is linked to the vrpn library.
    (http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/vrpn)


Examples
========

There are some basic examples within your Avango NG installation,
that show the configuration and usage of these input devices.
